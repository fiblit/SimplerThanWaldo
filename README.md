## Main Project Goal: 
Human 3D Pose Estimation from Monocular 2D Images

## Contributors
Jacquelyn Sloan, Kyle Fox, Dalton Hildreth

## Goals
### Necessary Goals for Core Idea:
#### Notes
Without these our project would not seem complete
#### Task List
* Human Pose Estimation from Monocular
* 3D pose estimation via various methods

### Highly Desired Goals:
#### Notes
Goals which could lead to improved performance or a more interesting project
#### Task List
* Efficient post-processing for real-time
* Stereo or alternative methods for more efficient/viable 3D estimation

### Stretch Goals:
#### Notes
Try not to take these last few too seriously.
#### Task List
* Moving camera setup (attached to robot)
* Robot collision avoidance/threading the needle (don’t get kicked!)
* Iteratively make part of an Autocar’s vision.
 
## Division Of Labor
* Jacqui: Methods of extracting human features from 2-D images & Image pre-processing
* Kyle: Extraction of 2D pose estimates from detected human features.
* Dalton: Using 2D poses and camera information to estimate and reconstruct 3D human poses
