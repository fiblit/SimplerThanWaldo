/*
Perform ANN on the pose database using MotionParser to read in motionfiles/searchposes and Pose to represent poses.
Once the nearest pose has been found, I'll need to properly project it into 3D space using the 2D pose.
I may pre-read the poses so as to structure them into a spatial data-structure.
I'll actually do this tomorrow morning. Been a bit busy.
